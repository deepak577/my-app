He was born in a respected Brahmin family from Barddhaman in Bengal, and grew up to become a famous doctor. But he left all that behind to live in Vrindavan and dedicate his life to Radha and Krishna as a renounced monk.","His Gurudev was Siddha Bhagavan Das Babaji of Ambika Kalna. He also got the blessings of many great souls in Vrindavan. One of those great souls was Sri Premanand Goswami of Shringar Vat, a descendant of Shri Nityananda Prabhu.","One day Baba was feeling a heavy lack of inspiration in his bhajan. That day when he visited Shringar Vat, Premanand Goswami noticed Baba\u2019s sadness. He told him to roll in the dust of Vrindavan, which he did immediately. At that moment the joy of Radha and Krishna\u2019s love returned to his heart. After Premanand Goswami passed away, Baba would roll in the dust of Vrindavan in front of Goswami ji\u2019s samadhi (tomb) if he felt disturbed at heart.","Once Baba\u2019s brother came from Bengal to visit him. Upon hearing the news that his brother\u2019s wife had died, Baba said, 'Oh, that\u2019s wonderful! Now the bondage of family life is broken for you! You can come to Vrindavan and do bhajan.'","After his brother left, Baba realized his mistake. \u201cI must have hurt my brother very badly,\u201d Baba thought. 'I should have comforted him instead.'","Baba had no idea where his brother was staying in Vrindavan, and he did not have his address in Bengal either. So Baba made the journey to Hathras train station three days in a row, hoping to meet his brother there. But unfortunately his brother never came.","Baba then wrote a letter to a friend in Barddhaman, asking him to find his brother and ask forgiveness on his behalf.","At last Baba received a reply from his brother that he was not hurt, but that he would not be visiting anymore, because he felt he had distracted Baba from his\xa0bhajan.\xa0He did not wish to disturb him further.","Every year on the disappearance day of his Gurudev, Baba used to make a mini festival by offering just a few\xa0malpowas\xa0(sweet pancakes) and distributing pieces of them as\xa0prasad.","Then one year, a devotee gave Baba forty rupees to hold a small feast on the occasion. Baba personally went to the market an\xa0bought 20 rupees worth of\xa0gur\xa0(jaggery) for making\xa0malpowas.","When Baba returned home, he left the bags of\xa0gur\xa0in his hut and went to wash his feet by the well. But he forgot to latch the door. When he came back, he found that a gang of monkeys had torn open the bags and were having a grand time feasting on the\xa0gur.\xa0Baba laughed began to recite the\xa0prem dhwani\xa0(prayers before a feast).","That evening the devotee who had sponsored the \u201cfeast\u201d came to see Baba. Baba told him, 'So many Vaishnavs were served today by your mercy!' But there was no sign that a feast had occurred.","When that devotee asked for prasad, Baba said, 'I bought twenty rupees worth of\xa0gur\xa0and the sacred monkeys of Vrindavan blessed me with their presence. They had a grand festival in my hut and left. Their remnants are still there on the floor, you may take some prasad from there. And here is the rest of your money; please use it to serve the Vaishnavs once more.","If anyone ever criticized another person or talked about their faults, Baba used to stop them and tell this story.","\u201cOnce a devotee said to Shri Bhagavan Das Babaji Mahashay, \u2018So-and-so comes here and he talks like some big devotee. But he has not even given up eating fish!\u2019","\u201cBabaji Mahashay asked him, \u2018Have you ever eaten fish?\u2019","\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he replied. \u2018But I don\u2019t eat it anymore.\u2019","\u201c\u2019Just like that, he will also quit eating fish one day,\u2019 replied Babaji Mahashay.","\u201cShri Bhagavan Das Babaji Mahashay did not approve of this kind of talk.

In fact, he never asked his disciples for donations even though many were wealthy. He and his wife were completely renounced and full of devotion.","Even though they had no bank account, no land and no house, they continually served their family deities, Sri Sri Radha Madana Gopala.

Outside of human vision B\u0101b\u0101 completed his duties in his ku\u1e6d\u012br in the complete darkness of that new moon night. After this he began to study the devotional scriptures.

While he was lecturing his dream suddenly broke. The next morning he told his father about his dream, and his father said: \u201cBoy, this is a true dream. Today you have to lecture at R\u0101sa Bih\u0101r\u012b Mah\u0101nta\u2019s Mandir. Your middle brother has done this until now, but now he is very ill, so prepare yourself.\u201d B\u0101b\u0101 had, however, just commenced his scriptural studies a few days earlier. He panicked and as he wanted to express his inability to his father, his father had already understood his predicament and placed the dust of his lotus feet upon his head, saying: \u201cMy child, do not fear \u2013 whatever you will say during this lecture will be elixir for the ears and heart, as the Bh\u0101gavata says \u2013 h\u1e5bt kar\u1e47a ras\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b.\u201d As father blessed him and assured him like this, B\u0101b\u0101 felt a superhuman power coming over him. Relying on his father\u2019s foot-dust he mounted the vy\u0101s\u0101sana in that great assembly. It was great to see how he firmly sat down on that elevated seat. There was a huge audience there of all the foremost saints of the time. Everyone present saw only a divine light, created by penance. All, whether young or old, stared at him thirstily as if spellbound by a mantra. His matted locks, his pleasant creamy complexion, his broad chest and forehead, his whole figure grave by meditation, he illuminated the whole assembly hall with his divine radiance. As soon as B\u0101b\u0101\u2019s lecture commenced, the thousands of throats of the audience fell dead silent. It was as if \u015aukadeva (who was also half-naked and wore matted locks) sat in front of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and the assembled sages on the bank of the Ganges, listening to the topics of \u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavata from his divine mouth, like a nectar-Ganges descending upon them. What could compare to their divine bliss! Everyone was speechless. At the end of the lecture everyone sat fixed on their seat, bereft of external consciousness, like bumblebees inebriated by drinking divine honey. What could anyone say to anyone else? No one was able to get up or speak \u2013 the lecture was still reverberating in their ear-shells. Mothers had forgotten their children, s\u0101dhakas had forgotten their m\u0101l\u0101 japa. Everyone was perplexed, like a snake that lost the jewels on its hoods (\u09ae\u09a3\u09a3\u09b9\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09ab\u09a3\u09c0) \u2013 nothing could compare to B\u0101b\u0101\u2019s lectures! Devotees led by Panc\u0101nan Ghosh, a senior wealthy resident of Navadv\u012bpa Dh\u0101ma, went to see B\u0101b\u0101\u2019s father afterwards and told him: \u201cPrabhup\u0101da, have you invested all your inner power into your youngest son?\u201d B\u0101b\u0101\u2019s father could understand it was a special day \u2013 unless the devotees proclaim so, the holy Dh\u0101ma could not have become blessed in such a way. It is not an overstatement to say that even now the holy Gaura-Dh\u0101ma of Navadv\u012bpa has never been blessed with such sweet nectar topics of the Holy Bh\u0101gavat. When \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012b \u0100nanda Gop\u0101l Gosv\u0101m\u012b heard such glorifications of his son he lost himself in divine bliss and could not help kissing his qualified son on the forehead in blessing.","When B\u0101b\u0101 was of adolescent age he was an independent s\u0101dhaka \u2013 with firm determination he continuously progressed, like a meteor. He would not respond to anyone\u2019s call, as he had no time for that. He was free from external conditioning and apparently did not strictly follow the spiritual family tradition either. He was a bit different \u2013 a great yog\u012b steeped in meditation. His two elder brothers did follow the family tradition and assisted their father in devotional programmes. They were somewhat dismissive of their younger brother\u2019s spiritual practises. One day they took the opportunity to submit to their father: \u201cFather, we are very busy with all the devotional programs going on in our home \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be good if you ordered \u015ar\u012bm\u0101n Niku in assisting us a bit?\u201d \u015ar\u012b \u0100nanda Gop\u0101l Prabhu agreed and B\u0101b\u0101 was compelled to accept this. B\u0101b\u0101 had not yet paid sufficient attention to the topic of the Bh\u0101gavata, yet he had to comply with the order of his father. His father assured him, saying: \u201cMy son, you need not worry - by my blessing all that is revealed in your meditationsteeped consciousness will be compatible with the verdict of the bhakti-scriptures.\u201d Blissfully taking the foot-dust of his father on his head, B\u0101b\u0101 began to recite the Bh\u0101gavata for a week, day in day out, and the assembled devotees praised his skills with hundreds and thousands of mouths. His father and brothers enthusiastically blessed, praised and rewarded him. All the assembled devotees accepted B\u0101b\u0101 as a unique and independent mah\u0101puru\u1e63a, whose knowledge was self-revealed.","Gop\u0101l Candra Ghosh: \u201cAdvaita D\u0101s B\u0101b\u0101ji was the first disciple of \u0100nanda Gop\u0101l Gosv\u0101m\u012b.

Advaita D\u0101sji and Niku\xf1ja Prabhu were very fond of each other, so Advaita D\u0101sji requested B\u0101b\u0101 to perform his last rites, which he did in 1958, when he passed away.

Who could console Gop\u0101l (B\u0101b\u0101)? His whole world had turned dark; it made him show his real nature and cast off his external appearance. He used to wear a fancy dhoti with kurta and a golden pen in the pocket. Now he cast off this worldly appearance, having no more taste for fine cloth and ornaments, put on course short cloth and grew his famous matted locks (ja\u1e6d\u0101s). Many parties came to him for marriage, but he always declined. No one was any more wondering whether B\u0101b\u0101 would leave home, only when. He stayed, however, to engage in the service of his broken-hearted father. He could not fully dedicate his mind anymore, though","After some time B\u0101b\u0101 became interested in music. Within a short while he mastered the art of music and could play his favourite tunes. He often mentioned the songs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u2019s Harid\u0101s Sw\u0101mi as his favourites. His musical skills too, like his scriptural knowledge, were self-taught and internally revealed. His father proudly called him a \u015brutidhara, a person who learns through a single hearing. Will a forest bird, however, like to stay in a cage? The bird of B\u0101b\u0101\u2019s mind was flying from one ku\xf1ja of nature to the other, absorbed in relishing the sweet juice of the mango buds there. Forgetting the world, B\u0101b\u0101 took his V\u012b\u1e47\u0101 to his chest and sang to the lotus feet of his beloved Lord in his favourite tunes, while shedding tears. If ever his father called him: \u2018Niku! Niku!\u2019 how could he reply? His mind had forgotten his body and had become absorbed in dressing prem\u0101dhik\u0101 R\u0101dhik\u0101 in the ku\xf1jas of \u015ar\u012b V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.","This, however, did not last long.

Finally our young ascetic placed down his meditation mat to sit in a lotus position in a bluish meadow in the dense woods of Mount Manasa. Thus the days passed in penance. After some time the wild animals of the forest began to take shelter of B\u0101b\u0101. Mother Manas\u0101 (a snake) was blissfully playing hide-and-seek within his matted locks, which hung down to his feet. One day a mountain girl appeared with burning incense in her hand and offered oblations with this along with fruits, flowers and sandalwood pulp. After making this devotional offering she disappeared without anyone ever finding out her identity.
